# Network & Wi-Fi — Frequently Asked Questions

## General

**Q: What's the difference between the Guest network and the Operational network?**
A: The Operational network is for staff devices (POS terminals, tablets, back-office computers) and requires authentication with domain credentials. The Guest network is for customer devices, has no login requirement, and is bandwidth-limited to prevent interference with business operations. Never connect business-critical devices to the Guest network.

**Q: What router hardware does ServeWell use?**
A: Most locations use either the NetLink NL-3000 (primary model) or Cisco SG350 managed switch. Your site's specific equipment is documented in your local IT checklist. Both devices support dual-network segregation and are designed for hospitality environments.

**Q: Can I reboot the router myself if Wi-Fi goes down?**
A: Yes. A reboot often resolves connectivity issues. Power off the router for 30 seconds, then power it back on and wait 3–5 minutes for full startup. Avoid rebooting during peak service hours if possible, as all network traffic will be interrupted temporarily.

**Q: What's a VPN and why would I use one?**
A: A VPN (Virtual Private Network) encrypts your internet connection and masks your location, protecting sensitive data when accessing ServeWell systems remotely. If you're managing your store from off-site, use the ServeWell VPN client (contact IT for setup) rather than public Wi-Fi.

**Q: How do I connect a new device to the Operational network?**
A: Select "ServeWell-Ops" from available Wi-Fi networks, enter your domain username and password, and the device will authenticate. If the network doesn't appear, ensure the device is within range and restart its Wi-Fi. Contact IT if authentication fails after three attempts.

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Wi-Fi is slow or dropping connections. What should I do first?**
A: First, move closer to the router to rule out range issues. Then restart the affected device's Wi-Fi. If slowness persists across multiple devices, reboot the router (see General section). Slow speeds may also indicate bandwidth congestion—contact IT if issues continue after a reboot.

**Q: I can see the Wi-Fi network but can't connect.**
A: Verify you're selecting the correct network (Operational vs. Guest). For Operational, confirm your username and password are correct. Restart your device's Wi-Fi radio, then try again. If the problem persists, forget the network and reconnect from scratch. Contact IT if you still cannot authenticate.

**Q: The Operational network isn't showing up on my device.**
A: Check that Wi-Fi is enabled on your device and you're in range of the router. Restart the device's Wi-Fi. Ensure your device meets minimum OS requirements (iOS 12+, Android 8+, Windows 10+). If still missing, reboot the router and wait 5 minutes. If unavailable after that, raise a support ticket.

**Q: How do I know if my connection is secure?**
A: Operational network traffic is encrypted via WPA2/WPA3. Never enter sensitive information (passwords, card data) on the Guest network. For remote access, always use the ServeWell VPN. If you suspect a security issue, disconnect and notify IT immediately.

**Q: What should I do if a guest complains they can't access the Wi-Fi?**
A: Direct them to select "ServeWell-Guest" and no login is required. If they still can't connect, have them restart their device's Wi-Fi. Confirm the guest network is enabled (you can verify this by checking the router's light indicators). If a large number of guests report outages, reboot the router or contact IT.

## When to Call IT Support

**Q: When is a router reboot not sufficient and I should call IT?**
A: Call IT if Wi-Fi remains unavailable after a reboot and 5-minute wait, if specific devices cannot authenticate despite correct credentials, if the router is making unusual noises or has a red light, or if you suspect physical damage. Do not attempt to repair hardware yourself.

**Q: What issues require L2 (Level 2) IT support?**
A: L2 support handles firmware updates, network configuration changes, DHCP/DNS issues, VPN setup, managed switch configuration (Cisco SG350), and any hardware failures. You should contact L2 if basic troubleshooting (reboot, restart device, credential verification) doesn't resolve the issue.

**Q: What should I include when raising a network support ticket?**
A: Include your store location and name, router model (NetLink NL-3000 or Cisco SG350), which network is affected (Operational, Guest, or both), which devices are impacted, whether a reboot was attempted and result, and the exact error message or symptom. The more detail, the faster IT can resolve the issue.

**Q: Who do I contact for VPN access or remote work setup?**
A: Contact IT Support with your request and explain your use case (remote store management, off-site shift coverage, etc.). IT will provision VPN credentials and guide you through client installation—typically a 15-minute process. Do not share VPN credentials with other staff.

**Q: Is there a network maintenance window I should know about?**
A: Major network maintenance is typically scheduled for Sundays 2–4 AM to minimize impact on operations. Your store manager receives a notification 48 hours before. For planned outages during business hours, IT will provide advance notice. Check your email regularly for network maintenance announcements.
